# Cookielang
A simple, safe and strongly typed programming language made for fun.
Cookielang is also largely inspired by [Go](https://golang.org/) and [V](https://vlang.io)'s syntaxes

# ⚠ Work In Progress
Cookielang is still a very young language, so don't let it touch production just yet!

## Hello World
```rust
fn main() {}
```

## Comments
```rust
// Single line comment
/* Multi line comments
Foo bar */
```

## Functions
⚠ Code outside functions doesn't compile:
```rust
console.println("Hello Cookielang!") // Syntax Error
```
✅ So put it in a function:
```rust
fn main() {
    console.println("Hello Cookielang!")
}
```
